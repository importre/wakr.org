The site was built using [Web Starter Kit](http://developers.google.com/web/starter-kit), [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com). If you need any help on installation, please refer to  [quickstart](https://github.com/google/web-starter-kit#quickstart) guide.

## Gulp Commands

You can now use Gulp with the following commands to stay productive during development:

### Watch For Changes & Automatically Refresh Across Devices

```sh
$ gulp serve
```

This outputs an IP address you can use to locally test and another that can be used on devices connected to your network.
